# Learning Event Registration

An internal attendee management and check-in system for in-house learning events.

The application allows  staff to securely access a check-in dashboard, manage attendee records, import existing registration lists, search for attendees, and record attendance.


## Features

* **Staff Login** — Secure staff access using a shared password and JWT authentication.
* **Add Attendees** — Manually add an attendee if they are not already on the imported list.
* **Import Attendee Lists** — Import attendees from `.xlsx` or `.csv` files, or paste attendee data directly.
* **Search & Filter** — Search attendees by name, phone number, or email and filter by check-in status.
* **Check-In** — Mark attendees as checked in directly from the dashboard.
* **Export Attendee List** — Download the current attendee list as an `.xlsx` file.
* **Capacity Management** — Set an attendee capacity limit, enforced both on the frontend and backend.
* **Duplicate Prevention** — Duplicate phone numbers are automatically skipped during imports.

### `server.js`



### `public/login.html`

The staff login page used to authenticate users before accessing the check-in dashboard.

### `public/index.html`

The main dashboard where staff can:

* View attendees
* Search and filter the attendee list
* Add attendees
* Import attendee lists
* Check attendees in
* Export the current list

### `API_CONTRACT.md`

Documents the API endpoints expected by the frontend, including the required request and response formats.

Read this file first if you intend to build or replace the backend.

## Running Locally

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the application

For testing, the default staff password is:

```text
test1234
```

You can also specify your own password:

```bash
STAFF_PASSWORD=your-chosen-password npm start
```

### 3. Open the application

Once the server is running, open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

You will be redirected to the staff login page.

### Test Credentials

For local testing:

```text
Password: test1234
```

> **Security:** `test1234` is a test password only. Change it before deploying the application to a live environment.

## Environment Variables

The application supports the following environment variables:

| Variable             | Description                                       | Default            |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `MONGODB_URI`        | MongoDB connection string (**required**)          | none               |
| `STAFF_PASSWORD`     | Shared password used by event staff               | insecure placeholder |
| `JWT_SECRET`         | Secret used to sign authentication tokens         | insecure placeholder |
| `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY`| Paystack key for bank account resolution          | empty (disabled)   |
| `PORT`               | Port on which the server runs                     | `3000`             |

See `.env.example` for a template.

**Do not deploy the application using the default `STAFF_PASSWORD` or placeholder `JWT_SECRET`.**

---

## Health Check

`GET /health` returns `200 {"status":"ok"}` when the server is up and connected to
MongoDB, or `503 {"status":"degraded"}` otherwise. It requires no authentication and
is what the Docker `HEALTHCHECK` and any reverse proxy / uptime monitor should poll.

---

## Deploying with Docker (Contabo VPS)

The image is a two-stage `node:20-alpine` build with no native dependencies, so a
cold build on a VPS takes well under a minute and rebuilds after code changes only
re-copy the source (the `npm ci` layer is cached on `package*.json`).

```bash
# one-time on the VPS
git clone <repo-url> learning-event && cd learning-event
cp .env.example .env && nano .env      # set MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET, STAFF_PASSWORD

# build + start (detached, auto-restarts on reboot)
docker compose up -d --build

# verify
docker compose ps                       # STATUS should show "healthy" after ~20s
curl -s http://localhost:3000/health
```

Updating to a new version:

```bash
git pull && docker compose up -d --build
```

Put Nginx or Caddy in front of port 3000 for TLS. The container runs as the
unprivileged `node` user and logs are capped at 3 x 10 MB files.

---

## Attendee Import

Attendee lists can be imported in two ways:

### Excel or CSV Upload

The dashboard supports:

```text
.xlsx
.csv
```

Files are parsed directly in the browser using **SheetJS**, so the backend does not need to handle uploaded files.

### Paste Data

Attendee rows can also be pasted directly into the dashboard.

Both methods use the same backend import endpoint:

```text
/api/staff/attendees/import
```

Duplicate phone numbers are automatically skipped during import.

---

## Capacity Management

The application includes an attendee capacity limit.

The default capacity is:

```text
140 attendees
```

The capacity can be edited from the dashboard.

Capacity restrictions are enforced at both levels:

* Frontend/UI
* Backend/server

This prevents attendees from being added or imported after the configured capacity has been reached.

---

## Search & Filtering

Staff can search the attendee list using:

* Name
* Phone number
* Email address

The list can also be filtered by check-in status.

This allows staff to quickly identify attendees who have or have not checked in.

---

## Exporting Attendees

The current attendee list can be exported from the dashboard with a single click.

The exported file is provided in:

```text
.xlsx
```

format.
